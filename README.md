## Overview

This is a shopping list app to make shopping lists easy to create and easy to use. The lists that you use should be reusable and easy to share over different technologies. When shopping, items will be easy to find and ticked off as you go.

When the user has set up their lists, they can quickly get up their &#39;weekly shopping&#39; or &#39;fruit &amp; veg markets&#39; list and tick them off as they go.

It allows for users who want either simple lists or more complicated lists.
